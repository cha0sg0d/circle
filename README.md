This is a respository of my projects completed during Summer 2019.

Youth Turnout Rate Clean - a Python script to clean a messy .txt file. Output is a csv.

data_clean - a complicated Python data pipeline that transforms a large csv into an organized table of voting history.

data_pipeline - R code that opens and performs preliminary analysis on 15 million entries of voting history. (Note data not accessible due to privacy)

State Code Organizing - a Python script that creates a dict of State survey codes
